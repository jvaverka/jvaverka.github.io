I experienced some difficulty breaking into the job market, but I was steadfast in my pursuit to find a workplace where my education could be put to use. Armed with a math degree and zero technical experience, I somehow landed a job in the IT department of a major automotive OEM. Here I am five years later&#33; So this feels like the perfect time to reflect on my journey so far.</p> <h2 id=the_beginning ><a href="#the_beginning" class=header-anchor >The Beginning</a></h2> <p>I started in a business intelligence group. My team was assembled to gather, aggregate and report key performance indicators for dealerships across international markets. This role introduced me to some fundamentals, such as managing relational databases, data modeling, ETL &#40;short for Extract / Transform / Load&#41;, and face-to-face interaction with business partners. That last skill being perhaps the most important and would serve me well in the future. However, what I remember most about this role is the team. We were small but ambitious. We moved fast, worked hard, trusted each other and we accomplished our goals.</p> <p>Later I worked in a customer relationship management &#40;or CRM&#41; group. The team was tasked to define, test and generate manifests for marketing campaigns across multiple media channels &#40;letter, email, phone&#41;. In this new area, I had to stay up-to-date on all data privacy laws and best practices. Additionally, I improved upon my data management skills such as data cleansing, munging and wrangling. I also got my first taste of Linux, and admittedly, I didn&#39;t see the big deal - that would come later. Personally, I had to learn to operate more like an individual contributor. This was challenging at times, but in the end helped me to become a more independent developer.</p> <h2 id=the_big_show ><a href="#the_big_show" class=header-anchor >The Big Show</a></h2> <p>After two years I wanted a change. The idea was to combine my newfound technical skills with my interests in mathematics. Not knowing exactly what I was looking for, I began to search throughout the company. Finally, I found the High Performance Compute &#40;HPC&#41; &amp; Open-Source Software Application Development Team. I only knew what a couple of those words meant, but I was excited about the opportunity and I took it&#33;</p> <p>The objective - create innovative solutions for Computer Aided Engineering &#40;CAE&#41; using free and open-source software &#40;FOSS&#41;. This grew into many desktop, web, monitoring and service applications. In the end, I was involved in everything from data transfers to data serialization, file management to memory management, workflow curation to job monitoring, user-experience to remote post-processing, and managing business partner coordination to individually leading feature development. I grew a tremendous amount as a developer, leader and person in a short time due to the amazing amount of talent and determination on the team &#40;and a special shout-out to my boss who believes in me and fuels my curiosity&#41;.</p> <p>Three plus years on this team gave me skills I never knew existed. It was a long journey. I had to come to work every day ready to learn. Over time and after asking countless questions, I became the one with the answers. Not only that, but I started to take on personal projects to test out newly encountered technology. I was coming into my own personally and professionally.</p> <h2 id=reflection ><a href="#reflection" class=header-anchor >Reflection</a></h2> <p>A lot happened. So what did I learn? I entered the work force a naive young man. I had a true desire to work hard and improve my company. However, things did not prove to be that simple, and I struggled with some aspects of working in such a large company. Thankfully, I was able to &quot;<em>keep the faith</em>&quot; as my manager would say, and I kept searching for a team where my skills and passions could shine - and one day that is exactly what happened&#33;</p> <p>I carved out a home in that crazy big machine. I gave a lot of long hours and hard work, and in return the company helped me grow in unexpected ways. Here I am now, a little less young and naive. As I reflect it&#39;s obvious that my greatest contribution to any of the efforts above was not my knowledge of Calculus, Statistics, or Number Theory. The greatest value I can add comes from my ability and desire to communicate ideas. The ability to communicate and understand complex situations - be it in a dataset or a team dynamic - has helped me succeed in a variety of ways. More importantly, this willingness to listen, and share &#40;usually in that order&#41; has made my team members <em>want</em> to work with me.</p> <p>That is the most important thing I could learn in my first five years in software development. I&#39;m incredibly grateful, and excited to continue my work.</p> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; Jacob Vaverka. Last modified: November 19, 2021.
