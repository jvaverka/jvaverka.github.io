**Fun fact**

In high school I learned to solve a [Rubik's Cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube) and got pretty fast at solving it (best ~45 seconds).
Years later I was gifted a [Megaminx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megaminx) - a dodecahedron shaped puzzle with 12 faces and 50 movable pieces - and used only my knowledge of the standard 3x3 Rubik's Cube to solve it in a few hours.
