The single factor model is related to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM),
which explains that investors need to be compensated for two main things:
time value and risk.  The time value portion of the return is captured by a
risk-free rate.  The risk of a security is captured by a risk measure that
compares returns of the asset to returns of the market (a market premium).
In form:

$\bar{r}_{a} = r_{f} + \beta_{a}(\bar{r}_{m} - r_{f})$

``r_{f}`` is the risk free rate.

``\beta_{a}`` is the beta of the security.

``\bar{r}_{m}`` is the market permium (excess return).

The concept of a single factor model follows very closely to the theories
behind the CAPM.  If we were to extend the CAPM idea of return being composed
of the some unexplained return characteristic and some relationship to a market
premium, we can construct a factor model doing just that:
