# About

I have been a professional developer at [General Motors](https://www.gm.com/) since 2016
after graduating with a Mathematics degree from [University of Georgia](https://www.uga.edu/).

I have been fortunate in my time at GM to learn many technical skills and apply them to a variety of areas across our IT organization. My work revolves around [CFD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_fluid_dynamics) and [CAE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_engineering). More specifically, my team drives to create a highly productive ecosystem for vehicle simulations. We build powerful tools which enable engineers to leverage free-and-open-source software in our high performance computing environment.

My involvement in this open-source initiative _(along with my continued interest in mathematics and physics)_ led me to the Julia Programming Language in 2018. Julia has proven to be a great way for me to express my ideas through code. So don't be surprised to learn that I take on many projects with Julia, including this website. See more details in the page foot.

When I'm not coding, I'm spending time with family. I love cooking, movies and board games.
