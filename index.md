On this site I keep notes on mathematics, software development, and related topics.

## About

I've been working at General Motors as a software & application developer since 2016,
building powerful tools to help engineers leverage free-and-open-source software
for vehicle simulations in our high performance computing environment.

I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics at the University of Georgia,
and I'm currently working toward a Master of Science in Applied & Computational
Mathematics at Johns Hopkins University.

A course in Matrix Theory led me to the Julia Programming Language in 2018.
Julia has helped me clearly express my ideas through code ever since.
I enjoy it so much, even this website is written in Julia!
