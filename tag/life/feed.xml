<h3 id="origins">Origins</h3>
<p>In 2019 I was living in Detroit and experiencing the coldest winter of my life - we&#39;re talking <strong>subzero for two weeks</strong> straight, cold. During the day I was programming software to run Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations on a High Performance Compute environment. At night I was continuing my education in Applied Mathematics by taking a course in Matrix Theory. Mostly, I was just trying to stay warm. Overall, things were going well. I was leveling up my software development game and even got to use my math degree from time to time on some projects. Little did I know things were only going to get better.</p>
<p>My Matrix Theory professor, let&#39;s call him <em>Professor</em>, was the best. He allowed students to use their preferred programming language for computation, but he recommended we consider using a new language called <strong>Julia</strong>. According to Professor, Julia was really an up and coming language, and for the first few assignments Professor challenged the MATLAB, Python, and R users to match the speed and expressiveness achieved by Julia. The results were impressive, and I was sold. Before long, I was hooked.</p>
<h3 id="adoption">Adoption</h3>
<p>After my coursework I fought to get Julia a foothold my industry. My team at work was a shining example of a group suffering from <a href="https://youtu.be/qGW0GT1rCvs">the two language problem</a>. We had brilliant engineers and talented software developers. Sure, we were productive, but I wanted to help us work smarter, develop faster, and build more impactful tools. With Julia, I felt I had just the thing.</p>
<p>My best bet was to become the Julia champion. So for the next 1¬Ω years, my free time was spent researching the language, the ecosystem, the tooling, everything. I had a new hobby, and soon I became &quot;the Julia guy&quot; in the office.</p>
<h3 id="arrival">Arrival</h3>
<p>The deeper I looked the more rewarding the experience. I joined the community Discourse, Discord, Slack, Zulip, etc. You name it, I was there. I loved finding out what folks were able to build with Julia. Even cooler, I found out that this community of Julians was made up of kind, smart, and diverse people living all over the world.</p>
<p>While I was hoping to champion Julia from within my company, I didn&#39;t wait to begin making small contributions. I started building fun web dashboards with <code>Dash.jl</code>, helpful study materials with <code>Symbolics.jl</code>, this website with <code>Franklin.jl</code>, and even helped &#40;a <em>tiny</em> bit&#41; support <code>LanguageServer.jl</code> in <a href="https://www.lunarvim.org/languages/julia.html#julia">LunarVim</a>. After gaining some confidence I was able to help other newcomers by pointing out useful Packages and improving documentation.</p>
<p>All the time invested in Julia paid off in the unexpected form of a job offer. I can happily say that my favorite hobby is now also my day job&#33; So if you are at all curious about this ambitious, <a href="https://julialang.org/blog/2012/02/why-we-created-julia/">greedy</a>, new language called Julia, then I would encourage you to join the community.  I found my dream job. Who knows what you&#39;ll discover.</p>
<p>Thank you to all Julians who helped me get started and encouraged me to keep exploring üôè</p>
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<p>In case you are interested in learning more about the Julia Programming Language or Applied Linear Algebra, here are some resources that helped me on my journey.</p>
<h3 id="julia_programming_language">Julia Programming Language</h3>
<p>Instructions for joining the many community channels can be found on the <a href="https://julialang.org/community/">community</a> page of the official <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia Lang</a> website.</p>

<h3 id="applied_linear_algebra">Applied Linear Algebra</h3>
<p>My Matrix Theory course was taught with two complementary books:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/applied-linear-algebra">Applied Linear      Algebra</a>      primarily focuses on theory</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/vmls/">Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra ‚Äì Vectors, Matrices, and Least      Squares</a> &#40;VMLS for short&#41; focus      more on application of the subject matter</p>
</li>
</ul>
