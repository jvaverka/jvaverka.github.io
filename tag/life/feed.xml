<h2 id="free_as_in_beer">Free As In Beer</h2>
<div class="franklin-toc"><ol><li>Free As In Beer<ol><li>GNU / Linux</li><li>Bad News<ol><li>Dependency Hell</li></ol></li><li>Good News</li></ol></li><li>Conclusion<ol><li>References</li></ol></li></ol></div>
<h3 id="gnu_linux">GNU / Linux</h3>
<p>Linux &#40;or GNU/Linux&#41; is a free and open-source operating system that I started using around 2018. Actually, my first encounter was in 2016, but I was a mere philistine who couldn&#39;t comprehend its relevance. Not coincidentally, re-introduction corresponded with my joining a high-powered development team. Embracing Linux &#40;and open-source software in general&#41; revealed a new perspective on what was possible on computers.</p>
<p>However, there is some good news and some bad news. Such is life.</p>
<h3 id="bad_news">Bad News</h3>
<p>Now, there is an old adage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Linux is only free if your time has no value.<sup id="fnref:linux">[1]</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I.e., prepare yourself for a time-sink.</p>
<p>I believe most Linux users would concede this point.<sup id="fnref:but">[2]</sup> The learning curve is real, it can be steep, and only the committed among us survive the journey to reap the reward.</p>
<p>While we&#39;re at it, let&#39;s gripe a bit:</p>
<p>🍇 Terminals are scary &#40;at first&#41;<sup id="fnref:term">[3]</sup></p>
<p>🍇 Hardware support not guaranteed &#42;cough&#42; GPUs &amp; Bluetooth</p>
<p>🍇 Foot-guns are a thing</p>
<p>What&#39;s a <em>foot-gun</em> you ask. Let me demonstrate.</p>
<h4 id="dependency_hell">Dependency Hell</h4>
<p><img src="./world-of-pain.jpg" alt="world-of-pain" /></p>
<p>Never heard of <a href="https://harfbuzz.github.io/"><code>harfbuzz</code></a>? Me neither until I thought ligatures were a real terminal necessity. Don&#39;t know what ligatures are? Maybe your better off not knowing.<sup id="fnref:jk">[4]</sup> Gross over simplification - <code>harfbuzz</code> is a library needed for ligatures. No problem - there&#39;s a build section in the library docs, and after my first <code>meson build</code> I have my ligatures&#33;</p>
<p>I&#39;m pretty pleased until some time later upon realizing that several other programs depend on this library and are now failing. One solution proposed on Arch Wiki was to set the <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> environment variable to help each program find its preferred library. Kind of a hack-y band aid, but it got me unstuck and working again. &quot;Flipping&quot; this additional switch was fine until I ran across programs that failed no matter which way the switch was flipped. Finally, I was forced to confront the real problem.</p>
<p>The solution - do another <code>meson build</code> with an additional flag that was needed for my particular system and which was not well documented. This was painful. When you&#39;re navigating uncharted waters, it&#39;s unclear where the danger will be lurking. However, that does <em>NOT</em> mean that you should be scared to explore. This bout frustrated me at times, but I learned about <code>harfbuzz</code> and why programs like <code>Libre Office</code> and <code>Pandoc</code> rely on it.</p>
<p>Anyone who gets started with Linux will find their own unique <em><em>Harfbuzz Hell</em></em> because each user will customize their machine to their liking for their functions. So best advise is embrace it and look for the learning opportunities. They are plentiful.</p>
<h3 id="good_news">Good News</h3>
<p>Congratulations for making it to the good news &#40;we&#39;re almost done here&#41;. In keeping with the theme, here is another obscure quote.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To like only for some future goal is shallow. It&#39;s the sides of the mountain which sustain life, not the top. Here&#39;s where things grow.<sup id="fnref:zen">[5]</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Diving into the unknown and keeping an open mind will reveal many treasures. So many brilliant people have worked hard on a project and selflessly shared the end product. There&#39;s really no <em>need</em> to pay for an operating system or any software if you don&#39;t want to. A little exploration will prove this, and those things which seemed scary will turn out to be over-sized teddy bears.</p>
<p>There&#39;s too many to count, but here are some things I appreciate:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>💙 Terminals ⇒ beautifully simple command line tools<sup id="fnref:cli">[6]</sup></p>
</li>
<li><p>💙 Open-source ⇒ constant innovations</p>
</li>
<li><p>💙 Freedom &#40;as in speech&#41; ⇒ customize everything<sup id="fnref:de">[7]</sup></p>
</li>
<li><p>💙 Shell ⇒ script automate everything</p>
</li>
<li><p>💙 Options ⇒ for those who want better</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p><img src="./opinion.jpg" alt="opinion" /></p>
<p>Things can be free, as in beer<sup id="fnref:free">[8]</sup>, as in costs no money. Or things can be free, as in speech, as in do whatever you want just leave me out of it. There&#39;s many cases of both throughout Linux and the wider Open-source community.</p>
<p>Sound good? Remember, anyone can do this and there is nothing to lose.</p>
<p>If you want to save a buck on expensive software, then try. If you don&#39;t like it, then go back to your comfort zone. You&#39;ll be more educated for trying.</p>
<p>If you are the type that wants to know your machine, understand how it works, and how to fix it yourself when it doesn&#39;t, then you will be right at home.</p>
<p>Share this with a curious soul or anyone asking about Linux.</p>

<h2 id="my_julia_story">My Julia Story</h2>
<div class="franklin-toc"><ol><li>My Julia Story<ol><li>Origins</li><li>Adoption</li><li>Arrival</li></ol></li><li>Resources<ol><li>Julia</li><li>Applied Linear Algebra</li></ol></li></ol></div>
<h3 id="origins">Origins</h3>
<p>In 2019 I was living in Detroit and experiencing the coldest winter of my life - we&#39;re talking <strong>subzero for two weeks</strong> straight, cold. During the day I was programming software to run Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations on a High Performance Compute environment. At night I was continuing my education in Applied Mathematics by taking a course in Matrix Theory. Mostly, I was just trying to stay warm. Overall, things were going well. I was leveling up my software development game and even got to use my math degree from time to time on some projects. Little did I know things were only going to get better.</p>
<p>My Matrix Theory professor, let&#39;s call him <em>Professor</em>, was the best. He allowed students to use their preferred programming language for computation, but he recommended we consider using a new language called <strong>Julia</strong>. According to Professor, Julia was really an up and coming language, and for the first few assignments Professor challenged the MATLAB, Python, and R users to match the speed and expressiveness achieved by Julia. The results were impressive, and I was sold. Before long, I was hooked.</p>
<h3 id="adoption">Adoption</h3>
<p>After my coursework I fought to get Julia a foothold my industry. My team at work was a shining example of a group suffering from <a href="https://youtu.be/qGW0GT1rCvs">the two language problem</a>. We had brilliant engineers and talented software developers. Sure, we were productive, but I wanted to help us work smarter, develop faster, and build more impactful tools. With Julia, I felt I had just the thing.</p>
<p>My best bet was to become the Julia champion. So for the next 1½ years, my free time was spent researching the language, the ecosystem, the tooling, everything. I had a new hobby, and soon I became &quot;the Julia guy&quot; in the office.</p>
<h3 id="arrival">Arrival</h3>
<p>The deeper I looked the more rewarding the experience. I joined the community Discourse, Discord, Slack, Zulip, etc. You name it, I was there. I loved finding out what folks were able to build with Julia. Even cooler, I found out that this community of Julians was made up of kind, smart, and diverse people living all over the world.</p>
<p>While I was hoping to champion Julia from within my company, I didn&#39;t wait to begin making small contributions. I started building fun web dashboards with <code>Dash.jl</code>, helpful study materials with <code>Symbolics.jl</code>, this blog with <code>Franklin.jl</code>, and even helped &#40;a <em>tiny</em> bit&#41; support <code>LanguageServer.jl</code> in <a href="https://www.lunarvim.org/languages/julia.html#julia">LunarVim</a>. After gaining some confidence I was able to help other newcomers by pointing out useful Packages and improving documentation.</p>
<p>All the time invested in Julia paid off in the unexpected form of a job offer. I can happily say that my favorite hobby is now also my day job&#33; So if you are at all curious about this ambitious, <a href="https://julialang.org/blog/2012/02/why-we-created-julia/">greedy</a>, new language called Julia, then I would encourage you to join the community.  I found my dream job. Who knows what you&#39;ll discover.</p>
<p>Thank you to all Julians who helped me get started and encouraged me to keep exploring 🙏</p>
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<p>In case you are interested in learning more about the Julia Programming Language or Applied Linear Algebra, here are some resources that helped me on my journey.</p>
<h3 id="julia">Julia</h3>
<p>Instructions for joining the many community channels can be found on the <a href="https://julialang.org/community/">community</a> page of the official <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia Lang</a> website.</p>

<h3 id="applied_linear_algebra">Applied Linear Algebra</h3>
<p>My Matrix Theory course was taught with two complementary books:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/applied-linear-algebra">Applied Linear      Algebra</a>      primarily focuses on theory</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/vmls/">Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra – Vectors, Matrices, and Least      Squares</a> &#40;VMLS for short&#41; focus      more on application of the subject matter</p>
</li>
</ul>
