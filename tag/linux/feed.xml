<h3 id="free_beer">Free Beer?</h3>
<p>Things can be free, as in beer<sup id="fnref:free">[1]</sup>, as in costs no money. Or things can be free, as in speech, as in do whatever you want just leave me out of it. Linux is the shining example of both.</p>
<h3 id="gnu_linux">GNU / Linux</h3>
<p>Linux &#40;or GNU/Linux&#41; is a free and open-source operating system that I started using around 2018. Actually, my first encounter was in 2016, but I was a mere philistine who couldn&#39;t comprehend its relevance. Not coincidentally, re-introduction corresponded with my joining a high-powered development team. Embracing Linux &#40;and open-source software in general&#41; revealed a new perspective on what was possible on computers.</p>
<p>However, there is some good news and some bad news. Such is life.</p>
<h3 id="bad_news">Bad News</h3>
<p>There is an old adage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Linux is only free if your time has no value.<sup id="fnref:linux">[2]</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I.e., prepare yourself for a time-sink.</p>
<p>I believe most Linux users would concede this point.<sup id="fnref:but">[3]</sup> The learning curve is real, it can be steep, and only the committed among us survive the journey to reap the reward.</p>
<p>While we&#39;re at it, let&#39;s gripe a bit:</p>
<p>🍇 Terminals are scary &#40;at first&#41;<sup id="fnref:term">[4]</sup></p>
<p>🍇 Hardware support not guaranteed &#42;cough&#42; GPUs &amp; Bluetooth</p>
<p>🍇 Foot-guns are a thing</p>
<p>What&#39;s a <em>foot-gun</em> you ask. Let me demonstrate.</p>
<h4 id="dependency_hell">Dependency Hell</h4>
<p><img src="./world-of-pain.jpg" alt="world-of-pain" /></p>
<p>Ever heard of <a href="https://harfbuzz.github.io/"><code>harfbuzz</code></a>? Me neither until I thought ligatures were a real terminal necessity. Don&#39;t know what ligatures are? Maybe your better off not knowing.<sup id="fnref:jk">[5]</sup> Gross over simplification - <code>harfbuzz</code> is a library needed for ligatures. No problem - there&#39;s a build section in the library docs, and after my first <code>meson build</code> I have my ligatures&#33;</p>
<p>I&#39;m pretty pleased until some time later upon realizing that several other programs depend on this library and are now failing. One solution proposed on Arch Wiki was to set the <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> environment variable to help each program find its preferred library. Kind of a hack-y band aid, but it got me unstuck and working again. &quot;Flipping&quot; this additional switch was fine until I ran across programs that failed no matter which way the switch was flipped. Finally, I was forced to confront the real problem.</p>
<p>The solution - do another <code>meson build</code> with an additional flag that was needed for my particular system and which was not well documented. This was painful. When you&#39;re navigating uncharted waters, it&#39;s unclear where the danger will be lurking. However, that does <em>NOT</em> mean that you should be scared to explore. This bout frustrated me at times, but I learned about <code>harfbuzz</code> and why programs like <code>Libre Office</code> and <code>Pandoc</code> rely on it.</p>
<p>Anyone who gets started with Linux will find their own unique <em><em>Harfbuzz Hell</em></em> because each user will customize their machine to their liking for their functions. So best advise is embrace it and look for the learning opportunities. They are plentiful.</p>
<h3 id="good_news">Good News</h3>
<p>Congratulations for making it to the good news &#40;we&#39;re almost done here&#41;. In keeping with the theme, here is another obscure quote.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To live only for some future goal is shallow. It&#39;s the sides of the mountain which sustain life, not the top. Here&#39;s where things grow.<sup id="fnref:zen">[6]</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Diving into the unknown and keeping an open mind will reveal many treasures among the growing pains. There is a lot to explore. So many brilliant people have worked hard on open-source projects and selflessly shared the end product. There&#39;s really no <em>need</em> to pay for an operating system or any software if you don&#39;t want to. A little exploration will prove this, and those things which seemed scary will turn out to be over-sized teddy bears.</p>
<p>There&#39;s too many to count, but here are some things I appreciate:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>💙 Terminals ⇒ beautifully simple command line tools<sup id="fnref:cli">[7]</sup></p>
</li>
<li><p>💙 Open-source ⇒ constant innovations</p>
</li>
<li><p>💙 Shell ⇒ script automate everything</p>
</li>
<li><p>💙 Options ⇒ for those who want better</p>
</li>
<li><p>💙 Freedom &#40;as in speech&#41; ⇒ customize everything<sup id="fnref:de">[8]</sup></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="perfect_fit">Perfect Fit</h4>
<p>Every person has different need, use-case, aesthetic, etc. It follows that every person has a different <em>perfect</em> computer setup. Just like how the world is not black and white, not everyone can be fully described in one of two buckets.<sup id="fnref:os">[9]</sup></p>
<p>There is a richness in diversity in Linux. Users have a choice of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution">distribution</a> suited for particular purposes and tastes &#40;maybe too many choices so just pick <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> to start then <a href="https://embeddedinventor.com/distro-hopping-what-why-how-explained/">hop</a> to your desire&#41;. Users have a choice of <a href="https://itsfoss.com/what-is-desktop-environment/">desktop environment</a> that will help them fine tune the look and feel that works best for them. Finally, users have full control of their systems. Users can do <em>anything</em> and are only limited by the time they choose invest.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p><img src="./opinion.jpg" alt="opinion" /></p>
<p>Good software exists. Some of it&#39;s free-as-in-beer, some of it&#39;s free-as-in-speech. There&#39;s many cases of both throughout Linux and the wider Open-source community. Best part - it&#39;s for everybody&#33;</p>
<p>Remember, you are not alone. There is a strong community of Linux enthusiasts in the world who are willing and able to help you get started. Anyone can do this and there is nothing to lose.</p>
<p>Linux &#40;and Open-source software in general&#41; is a bountiful garden. Dig it.</p>
<p>Share this with a curious soul or anyone asking about Linux.</p>
