<div class="franklin-toc"><ol><li>Packages Versus Projects in Julia<ol><li>Pkg.jl</li><li>What is a Package?</li><li>What is a Project?</li></ol></li></ol></div>
<h3 id="pkgjl">Pkg.jl</h3>
<p>One of Julia&#39;s greatest strengths is its package manager, <code>Pkg.jl</code>. My goal here is to give new Julia users some helpful tips to get the most out of <code>Pkg.jl</code> right off the bat. To dive deeper, please check out the <a href="https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/">official documentation</a>.</p>
<h3 id="what_is_a_package">What is a Package?</h3>
<p>A package is a code base that performs some function. I.e., a package does a job, does it well, and nothing more. It is modular.</p>
<p>When multiple things need to be done, we sensibly organize the appropriate code into separate packages. Furthermore, we give these separate packages separate names so that we can understand what job they do well.</p>
<p>Say you want to work with Hyper Text Markup Language &#40;HTML&#41;. <code>HTTP.jl</code> can help send requests and read responses.</p>
<p>Say you want to work with JavaScript Object Notation &#40;JSON&#41;. <code>JSON3.jl</code> can help read and write data in this format.</p>
<p>Say you want to fetch random XKCD comic &#40;there is no meaning&#41;. <code>XKCD.jl</code> can deliver comics to you. The beautiful thing is, that it does so by using <code>HTTP.jl</code> in combination with <code>JSON3.jl</code>.</p>
<p>Packages are the building blocks of the Julia ecosystem. There are many great packages out there, and the ease of creating, distributing, and composing packages allows the ecosystem to rapidly grow.</p>
<p>Those interested in building and sharing their own Julia package should leverage <a href="https://invenia.github.io/PkgTemplates.jl/stable/">PkgTemplates.jl</a> to save time and minimize common mistakes.</p>
<h3 id="what_is_a_project">What is a Project?</h3>
<p>A project is what you create to do stuff.</p>
<p>Slightly more formally, a project is any Julia code base with its own environment. In general, it is always a good idea to create an new environment for new projects. This will minimize the chances of package conflicts. Luckily, creating a new project with a dedicated environment is easy to do. We&#39;ll quickly walk through the steps to create a new project named <code>ImportantWork</code>.</p>
<p>After you have fired up a Julia REPL, indicate that we&#39;ll be using the package manager &#40;we&#39;ll focus only on the most idiomatic way of doing this for now, but there is a <code>Pkg</code> REPL mode accessible with <code>&#93;</code> detailed in the official docs&#41;.</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia-repl">julia&gt; using Pkg</code></pre>
<p>Now to create our project.</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia-repl">julia&gt; Pkg.generate&#40;&quot;ImportantWork&quot;&#41;</code></pre>
<p>The output looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Generating  project ImportantWork:
    ImportantWork/Project.toml
    ImportantWork/src/ImportantWork.jl
Dict&#123;String, Base.UUID&#125; with 1 entry:
  &quot;ImportantWork&quot; &#61;&gt; UUID&#40;&quot;4b610261-c434-4966-b823-52987c24b398&quot;&#41;</code></pre>
<p>The Julia package manager just generated:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a directory, <code>ImportantWork</code> ⇒ where everything for the project lives</p>
</li>
<li><p>a subdirectory, <code>ImportantWork/src</code> ⇒ for building our code base</p>
</li>
<li><p>a file, <code>ImportantWork/src/ImportantWork.jl</code> ⇒ a module &#40;think <code>main</code>&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>a file, <code>ImportantWork/Project.toml</code> ⇒ for describing the environment</p>
</li>
<li><p>a UUID we won&#39;t worry about for now</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#39;s step into our new project with <code>cd</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia-repl">julia&gt; cd&#40;&quot;ImportantWork&quot;&#41;</code></pre>
<p>And check out <code>Project.toml</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia-repl">julia&gt; edit&#40;&quot;Project.toml&quot;&#41;</code></pre>
<p>The file contains some basic information about the project&#39;s environment.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">name &#61; &quot;ImportantWork&quot;
uuid &#61; &quot;4b610261-c434-4966-b823-52987c24b398&quot;
authors &#61; &#91;&quot;Your Name &lt;you@example.com&gt;&quot;&#93;
version &#61; &quot;0.1.0&quot;</code></pre>
<p>To begin working with this new environment, simply activate it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia-repl">julia&gt; Pkg.activate&#40;&quot;.&quot;&#41;  # the . here means &#39;this directory&#39;</code></pre>
<p>Now we can continue to the important project work. To do so, we&#39;ll need the important <code>XKCD.jl</code> package. So let&#39;s add it to the project.</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia-repl">julia&gt; Pkg.add&#40;&quot;XKCD&quot;&#41;</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">Updating registry at &#96;~/.julia/registries/General&#96;

Precompiling project...
  1 dependency successfully precompiled in 1 seconds &#40;9 already precompiled&#41;</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Project.toml</code> can again tell us what changed. There are 2 new lines.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">&#91;deps&#93;

<p>We are now free to use the package in our project.</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia-repl">julia&gt; edit&#40;&quot;src/ImportantWork.jl&quot;&#41;</code></pre>
<p>Paste the following code in the file. Save and quit.</p>
<pre><code class="language-julia">module ImportantWorkusing XKCDexport meaning_of_life

<p>Finally, we can get the answers we seek. Furthermore, if we are sure to include the <code>Project.toml</code> then we can share our important work with others. Then they too can get the answers.</p>

<h3 id="origins">Origins</h3>
<p>In 2019 I was living in Detroit and experiencing the coldest winter of my life - we&#39;re talking <strong>subzero for two weeks</strong> straight, cold. During the day I was programming software to run Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations on a High Performance Compute environment. At night I was continuing my education in Applied Mathematics by taking a course in Matrix Theory. Mostly, I was just trying to stay warm. Overall, things were going well. I was leveling up my software development game and even got to use my math degree from time to time on some projects. Little did I know things were only going to get better.</p>
<p>My Matrix Theory professor, let&#39;s call him <em>Professor</em>, was the best. He allowed students to use their preferred programming language for computation, but he recommended we consider using a new language called <strong>Julia</strong>. According to Professor, Julia was really an up and coming language, and for the first few assignments Professor challenged the MATLAB, Python, and R users to match the speed and expressiveness achieved by Julia. The results were impressive, and I was sold. Before long, I was hooked.</p>
<h3 id="adoption">Adoption</h3>
<p>After my coursework I fought to get Julia a foothold my industry. My team at work was a shining example of a group suffering from <a href="https://youtu.be/qGW0GT1rCvs">the two language problem</a>. We had brilliant engineers and talented software developers. Sure, we were productive, but I wanted to help us work smarter, develop faster, and build more impactful tools. With Julia, I felt I had just the thing.</p>
<p>My best bet was to become the Julia champion. So for the next 1½ years, my free time was spent researching the language, the ecosystem, the tooling, everything. I had a new hobby, and soon I became &quot;the Julia guy&quot; in the office.</p>
<h3 id="arrival">Arrival</h3>
<p>The deeper I looked the more rewarding the experience. I joined the community Discourse, Discord, Slack, Zulip, etc. You name it, I was there. I loved finding out what folks were able to build with Julia. Even cooler, I found out that this community of Julians was made up of kind, smart, and diverse people living all over the world.</p>
<p>While I was hoping to champion Julia from within my company, I didn&#39;t wait to begin making small contributions. I started building fun web dashboards with <code>Dash.jl</code>, helpful study materials with <code>Symbolics.jl</code>, this blog with <code>Franklin.jl</code>, and even helped &#40;a <em>tiny</em> bit&#41; support <code>LanguageServer.jl</code> in <a href="https://www.lunarvim.org/languages/julia.html#julia">LunarVim</a>. After gaining some confidence I was able to help other newcomers by pointing out useful Packages and improving documentation.</p>
<p>All the time invested in Julia paid off in the unexpected form of a job offer. I can happily say that my favorite hobby is now also my day job&#33; So if you are at all curious about this ambitious, <a href="https://julialang.org/blog/2012/02/why-we-created-julia/">greedy</a>, new language called Julia, then I would encourage you to join the community.  I found my dream job. Who knows what you&#39;ll discover.</p>
<p>Thank you to all Julians who helped me get started and encouraged me to keep exploring 🙏</p>
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<p>In case you are interested in learning more about the Julia Programming Language or Applied Linear Algebra, here are some resources that helped me on my journey.</p>
<h3 id="julia_programming_language">Julia Programming Language</h3>
<p>Instructions for joining the many community channels can be found on the <a href="https://julialang.org/community/">community</a> page of the official <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia Lang</a> website.</p>
<p>Wondering if Julia is a good choice for you and your projects? Start by reading <a href="https://juliadatascience.io/julia_accomplish">What Julia Aims to Accomplish</a>.</p>
<h3 id="applied_linear_algebra">Applied Linear Algebra</h3>
<p>My Matrix Theory course was taught with two complementary books:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/applied-linear-algebra">Applied Linear      Algebra</a>      primarily focuses on theory</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/vmls/">Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra – Vectors, Matrices, and Least      Squares</a> &#40;VMLS for short&#41; focus      more on application of the subject matter</p>
</li>
</ul>
