January 2016 marked the dawn of a new age.
I had my fair share of difficulty breaking into the job market, 
but I was steadfast in my pursuit of a workplace to call home.
Armed with a math degree and determination, I lucked into an interview with General Motors IT.
And here I am five years later!
So this feels like the perfect time to reflect on my journey so far.

## Roles

### Systems Developer
I started in the Global Sales, Planning \& Intelligence Org.
My team was assembled to gather, aggregate and report key performance indicators for dealerships across international markets.
This role introduced me to some IT foundations, such as managing relational databases, Data Modeling, ETL (short for Extract / Transform / Load), and face-to-face interaction with business partners.
That last skill begin perhaps the most important and would serve me well in the future.

#### Languages, Frameworks
* SQL
* R 
    * Ggplot2
    * Dyplr
    * Shiny
    * Lubridate
    * Swirl
    * RCrawler
* Python 
    * matplotlib
    * Plotly
    * Numpy
    * Pandas

#### Tools
* AutoSys (job scheduling)
* DataStage (IBM's ETL tool)
* Cognos (IBM's dashboard builder) 

#### Methodologies
* Agile

### Decision Support Analyst
Later I worked in the Customer Relationship Management Org.
The team was tasked to define, test and generate marketing campaign manifests for all GM brands across multiple media channels (letter, email, phone).
In this new area, I had to stay up-to-date on all data privacy laws / best practices.
Additionally, I improved upon my previously acquired data management skills such as data cleansing, munging and wrangling.

#### Languages
* shell scripting
* SAS 

#### Tools
* Regular Expressions
* Tableau
* Power BI 

#### Misc
* Ability to navigate difficulties collaborating with contract workers.

### HPC Application Developer
Finally I moved to Enterprise Technology Services Org.
Here I joined the High Performance Compute (HPC) Open-Source Application Development team.
Our objective - displace commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software for Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) with free and open-source software (FOSS) solutions and offer greater productivity to boot.
This culminated in a plethora of desktop, web, monitoring, and batch applications.
I personally contributed to many of these efforts, even being called the ’designated hitter’ -called to come in and get a particular feature through the finish line.
All told I was involved in everything from data transfers to data serialization, file management to memory management, workflow curation to job monitoring, user-experience to user-defined remote post-processing, and managing business partner cooperation to leading feature development.
I grew a tremendous amount as a developer, leader and person during this project due to the amazing amount of talent and determination on the team (and a special shout-out to my boss who believes in me and fuels my curiosity).

#### Languages, Frameworks
* C++
    *  STL
    * Boost
    * Qt

* Git | Bitbucket, GitLab, GitHub \& TFS
* {\LaTex}
* Markdown
* JSON
* ELK Stack (elasticsearch, logstash, kibana)

* Build Pipelines

## Reflection
A lot happened.  So what did I learn?
I entered the work force a naive young man.
I had a true desire to work hard and improve my company.
However, things did not prove to be that simple, and I struggled with some aspects of working in such a large company.
Thankfully, I was able to "_keep the faith_" as my first manager would say, and I kept searching for a team where my skills and passions could shine - until one day, I found it.

I carved a home out in this crazy big machine.
I've given a lot of long hours and hard work, and in return GM has helped me grow in unexpected ways.
And here I am now, a little less young, and to my surprise I realize that my greatest contribution to any of the efforts above was not my knowledge of Calculus, Combinatorics, or Number Theory.
The greatest value I can add comes from my ability and desire to communicate ideas.
Being able to communicate and understand complex situations - be it in a data set or a team dynamic - has helped me succeed in a variety of areas within the company.
More importantly, this willingness to listen, understand and share (usually in that order) has made my team members _want_ to work with me.

That is the most important thing I could learn in my five years at GM.  I'm incredibly grateful, and excited to continue my work.
