# Five Years with General Motors

\toc

## General Motors

January 2016 marked the dawn of a new age. I had my fair share of difficulty
breaking into the job market, but I was steadfast in my pursuit of a workplace
to call home. Armed with a math degree and determination, I lucked into an
interview with General Motors IT. Here I am five years later! So this feels
like the perfect time to reflect on my journey so far.

I started in the Global Sales, Planning & Intelligence Org. My team was
assembled to gather, aggregate and report key performance indicators for
dealerships across international markets. This role introduced me to some IT
foundations, such as managing relational databases, Data Modeling, ETL
(short for Extract / Transform / Load), and face-to-face interaction with
business partners. That last skill being perhaps the most important and would
serve me well in the future. However, what I remember most about this role is
the team. We were small, but ambitious. We moved fast, worked hard, trusted
each other and we accomplished our goals.

Later I worked in the Customer Relationship Management Org. The team was tasked
to define, test and generate marketing campaign manifests for all GM brands
across multiple media channels (letter, email, phone). In this new area, I had
to stay up-to-date on all data privacy laws / best practices. Additionally, I
improved upon my previously acquired data management skills such as data
cleansing, munging and wrangling. Personally, I had to learn to operate more
like an individual contributor. This was challenging at times, but in the end
helped me to become a more independent developer.

Finally I moved to Enterprise Technology Services Org. Here I joined the High
Performance Compute (HPC) Open-Source Application Development team. Our
objective - displace commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software for Computer Aided
Engineering (CAE) with free and open-source software (FOSS) solutions and offer
greater productivity to boot! This culminated in a plethora of desktop, web,
monitoring and service applications. I personally contributed to many of these
efforts, even being called the 'designated hitterâ€™ - called to come in and get
a particular feature through the finish line. All told I was involved in
everything from data transfers to data serialization, file management to memory
management, workflow curation to job monitoring, user-experience to remote
post-processing, and managing business partner coordination to individually
leading feature development. I grew a tremendous amount as a developer, leader
and person in a short time due to the amazing amount of talent and
determination on the team (and a special shout-out to my boss who believes in
me and fuels my curiosity).

## Reflection
A lot happened. So what did I learn? I entered the work force a naive young man.
I had a true desire to work hard and improve my company. However, things did not
prove to be that simple, and I struggled with some aspects of working in such a
large company. Thankfully, I was able to "_keep the faith_" as my first manager
would say, and I kept searching for a team where my skills and passions could
shine - until one day, I found it!

I carved a home out in this crazy big machine. I've given a lot of long hours
and hard work, and in return GM has helped me grow in unexpected ways. And here
I am now, a little less young and naive. To my surprise, my greatest
contribution to any of the efforts above was not my knowledge of Calculus,
Statistics, or Number Theory. The greatest value I can add comes from my ability
and desire to communicate ideas. Being able to communicate and understand
complex situations - be it in a data set or a team dynamic - has helped me
succeed in a variety of areas within the company. More importantly, this
willingness to listen, understand and share (usually in that order) has made my
team members _want_ to work with me.

That is the most important thing I could learn in my five years at GM.
I'm incredibly grateful, and excited to continue my work.
