I had my fair share of difficulty breaking into the job market, but I was steadfast in my pursuit of a workplace to call home. Armed with a math degree and determination, I lucked into an interview with General Motors IT. Here I am five years later&#33; So this feels like the perfect time to reflect on my journey so far.</p> <p>I started in the Global Sales, Planning &amp; Intelligence Org. My team was assembled to gather, aggregate and report key performance indicators for dealerships across international markets. This role introduced me to some IT foundations, such as managing relational databases, Data Modeling, ETL &#40;short for Extract / Transform / Load&#41;, and face-to-face interaction with business partners. That last skill being perhaps the most important and would serve me well in the future. However, what I remember most about this role is the team. We were small, but ambitious. We moved fast, worked hard, trusted each other and we accomplished our goals.</p> <p>Later I worked in the Customer Relationship Management Org. The team was tasked to define, test and generate marketing campaign manifests for all GM brands across multiple media channels &#40;letter, email, phone&#41;. In this new area, I had to stay up-to-date on all data privacy laws / best practices. Additionally, I improved upon my previously acquired data management skills such as data cleansing, munging and wrangling. Personally, I had to learn to operate more like an individual contributor. This was challenging at times, but in the end helped me to become a more independent developer.</p> <p>Finally I moved to Enterprise Technology Services Org. Here I joined the High Performance Compute &#40;HPC&#41; Open-Source Application Development team. Our objective - displace commercial off-the-shelf &#40;COTS&#41; software for Computer Aided Engineering &#40;CAE&#41; with free and open-source software &#40;FOSS&#41; solutions and offer greater productivity to boot&#33; This culminated in a plethora of desktop, web, monitoring and service applications. I personally contributed to many of these efforts, even being called the &#39;designated hitterâ€™ - called to come in and get a particular feature through the finish line. All told I was involved in everything from data transfers to data serialization, file management to memory management, workflow curation to job monitoring, user-experience to remote post-processing, and managing business partner coordination to individually leading feature development. I grew a tremendous amount as a developer, leader and person in a short time due to the amazing amount of talent and determination on the team &#40;and a special shout-out to my boss who believes in me and fuels my curiosity&#41;.</p> <h2 id=reflection ><a href="#reflection" class=header-anchor >Reflection</a></h2> <p>A lot happened. So what did I learn? I entered the work force a naive young man. I had a true desire to work hard and improve my company. However, things did not prove to be that simple, and I struggled with some aspects of working in such a large company. Thankfully, I was able to &quot;<em>keep the faith</em>&quot; as my first manager would say, and I kept searching for a team where my skills and passions could shine - until one day, I found it&#33;</p> <p>I carved a home out in this crazy big machine. I&#39;ve given a lot of long hours and hard work, and in return GM has helped me grow in unexpected ways. And here I am now, a little less young and naive. To my surprise, my greatest contribution to any of the efforts above was not my knowledge of Calculus, Statistics, or Number Theory. The greatest value I can add comes from my ability and desire to communicate ideas. Being able to communicate and understand complex situations - be it in a data set or a team dynamic - has helped me succeed in a variety of areas within the company. More importantly, this willingness to listen, understand and share &#40;usually in that order&#41; has made my team members <em>want</em> to work with me.</p> <p>That is the most important thing I could learn in my five years at GM. I&#39;m incredibly grateful, and excited to continue my work.</p> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; Jacob Vaverka. Last modified: July 16, 2021.
