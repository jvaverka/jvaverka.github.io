## My Julia Story

\toc

### Origins

In 2019 I was living in Detroit and experiencing the coldest winter of my life -
we're talking **subzero for two weeks** straight, cold. During the day I was
programming software to run Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations on a High
Performance Compute environment. At night I was continuing my education in
Applied Mathematics by taking a course in Matrix Theory. Mostly, I was just
trying to stay warm. Overall, things were going well. I was leveling up my
software development game and even got to use my math degree from time to time
on some projects. Little did I know things were only going to get better.

My Matrix Theory professor, let's call him _Professor_, was the best. He
allowed students to use their preferred programming language for computation,
but he recommended we consider using a new language called **Julia**. According
to Professor, Julia was really an up and coming language, and for the first few
assignments Professor challenged the MATLAB, Python, and R users to match the
speed and expressiveness achieved by Julia. The results were impressive, and I
was sold. Before long, I was hooked.

### Adoption

After my coursework I fought to get Julia a foothold my industry. My team at
work was a shining example of a group suffering from [the two language
problem](https://youtu.be/qGW0GT1rCvs). We had brilliant engineers and talented
software developers. Sure, we were productive, but I wanted to help us work
smarter, develop faster, and build more impactful tools. With Julia, I felt I
had just the thing.

My best bet was to become the Julia champion. So for the next 1½ years,
my free time was spent researching the language, the ecosystem, the tooling,
everything. I had a new hobby, and soon I became "the Julia guy" in the office.

### Arrival

The deeper I looked the more rewarding the experience. I joined the community
Discourse, Discord, Slack, Zulip, etc. You name it, I was there. I loved finding
out what folks were able to build with Julia. Even cooler, I found out that this
community of Julians was made up of kind, smart, and diverse people living all
over the world.

While I was hoping to champion Julia from within my company, I didn't wait to
begin making small contributions. I started building fun web dashboards with
`Dash.jl`, helpful study materials with `Symbolics.jl`, this blog with
`Franklin.jl`, and even helped (a _tiny_ bit) support `LanguageServer.jl` in
[LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/languages/julia.html#julia). After gaining
some confidence I was able to help other newcomers by pointing out useful
Packages and improving documentation.

All the time invested in Julia paid off in the unexpected form of a job offer. I
can happily say that my favorite hobby is now also my day job! So if you are at
all curious about this ambitious,
[greedy](https://julialang.org/blog/2012/02/why-we-created-julia/), new language
called Julia, then I would encourage you to join the community.  I found my
dream job. Who knows what you'll discover.

Thank you to all Julians who helped me get started and encouraged me to keep
exploring :pray:

## Resources

In case you are interested in learning more about the Julia Programming Language
or Applied Linear Algebra, here are some resources that helped me on my journey.

### Julia Programming Language

Instructions for joining the many community channels can be found on the
[community](https://julialang.org/community/) page of the official [Julia
Lang](https://julialang.org/) website.

Wondering if Julia is a good choice for you and your projects? Start by reading
[What Julia Aims to Accomplish](https://juliadatascience.io/julia_accomplish).

### Applied Linear Algebra

My Matrix Theory course was taught with two complementary books:

- [Applied Linear
       Algebra](https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/applied-linear-algebra)
       primarily focuses on theory
- [Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra – Vectors, Matrices, and Least
       Squares](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/vmls/) (VMLS for short) focus
       more on application of the subject matter
