During the day I was programming software to run Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations on a High Performance Compute environment. At night I was continuing my education in Applied Mathematics by taking a course in Matrix Theory. Mostly, I was just trying to stay warm. Overall, things were going well. I was leveling up my software development game and even got to use my math degree from time to time on some projects. Little did I know things were only going to get better.</p> <p>My Matrix Theory professor, let&#39;s call him <em>Professor</em>, was the best. He allowed students to use their preferred programming language for computation, but he recommended we consider using a new language called <strong>Julia</strong>. According to Professor, Julia was really an up and coming language, and for the first few assignments Professor challenged the MATLAB, Python, and R users to match the speed and expressiveness achieved by Julia. The results were impressive, and I was sold. Before long, I was hooked.</p> <h3 id=adoption ><a href="#adoption" class=header-anchor >Adoption</a></h3> <p>After my coursework I fought to get Julia a foothold my industry. My team at work was a shining example of a group suffering from <a href="https://youtu.be/qGW0GT1rCvs">the two language problem</a>. We had brilliant engineers and talented software developers. Sure, we were productive, but I wanted to help us work smarter, develop faster, and build more impactful tools. With Julia, I felt I had just the thing.</p> <p>My best bet was to become the Julia champion. So for the next 1¬Ω years, my free time was spent researching the language, the ecosystem, the tooling, everything. I had a new hobby, and soon I became &quot;the Julia guy&quot; in the office.</p> <h3 id=arrival ><a href="#arrival" class=header-anchor >Arrival</a></h3> <p>The deeper I looked the more rewarding the experience. I joined the community Discourse, Discord, Slack, Zulip, etc. You name it, I was there. I loved finding out what folks were able to build with Julia. Even cooler, I found out that this community of Julians was made up of kind, smart, and diverse people living all over the world.</p> <p>While I was hoping to champion Julia from within my company, I didn&#39;t wait to begin making small contributions. I started building fun web dashboards with <code>Dash.jl</code>, helpful study materials with <code>Symbolics.jl</code>, this blog with <code>Franklin.jl</code>, and even helped &#40;a <em>tiny</em> bit&#41; support <code>LanguageServer.jl</code> in <a href="https://www.lunarvim.org/languages/julia.html#julia">LunarVim</a>. After gaining some confidence I was able to help other newcomers by pointing out useful Packages and improving documentation.</p> <p>All the time invested in Julia paid off in the unexpected form of a job offer. I can happily say that my favorite hobby is now also my day job&#33; So if you are at all curious about this ambitious, <a href="https://julialang.org/blog/2012/02/why-we-created-julia/">greedy</a>, new language called Julia, then I would encourage you to join the community. I found my dream job. Who knows what you&#39;ll discover.</p> <p>Thank you to all Julians who helped me get started and encouraged me to keep exploring üôè</p> <h2 id=resources ><a href="#resources" class=header-anchor >Resources</a></h2> <p>In case you are interested in learning more about the Julia Programming Language or Applied Linear Algebra, here are some resources that helped me on my journey.</p> <h3 id=julia_programming_language ><a href="#julia_programming_language" class=header-anchor >Julia Programming Language</a></h3> <p>Instructions for joining the many community channels can be found on the <a href="https://julialang.org/community/">community</a> page of the official <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia Lang</a> website.</p> <p>Wondering if Julia is a good choice for you and your projects?
