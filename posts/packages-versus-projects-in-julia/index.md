## Packages Versus Projects in Julia

\toc

### Pkg.jl

One of Julia's greatest strengths is its package manager, `Pkg.jl`. My goal
here is to give new Julia users some helpful tips to get the most out of
`Pkg.jl` right off the bat. To dive deeper, please check out the [official
documentation](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/).

### What is a Package?

A package is a code base that performs some function. I.e., a package does a
job, does it well, and nothing more. It is modular.

When multiple things need to be done, we sensibly organize the appropriate code
into separate packages. Furthermore, we give these separate packages separate
names so that we can understand what job they do well.

Say you want to work with Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML). `HTTP.jl` can help
send requests and read responses.

Say you want to work with JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). `JSON3.jl` can
help read and write data in this format.

Say you want to fetch random XKCD comic (there is no meaning). `XKCD.jl` can
deliver comics to you. The beautiful thing is, that it does so by using
`HTTP.jl` in combination with `JSON3.jl`.

Packages are the building blocks of the Julia ecosystem. There are many great
packages out there, and the ease of creating, distributing, and composing
packages allows the ecosystem to rapidly grow.

Those interested in building and sharing their own Julia package should
leverage [PkgTemplates.jl](https://invenia.github.io/PkgTemplates.jl/stable/)
to save time and minimize common mistakes.

### What is a Project?

A project is what you create to do stuff.

Slightly more formally, a project is any Julia code base with its own
environment. In general, it is always a good idea to create an new environment
for new projects. This will minimize the chances of package conflicts. Luckily,
creating a new project with a dedicated environment is easy to do. We'll
quickly walk through the steps to create a new project named `ImportantWork`.

After you have fired up a Julia REPL, indicate that we'll be using the package
manager (we'll focus only on the most idiomatic way of doing this for now, but
there is a `Pkg` REPL mode accessible with `]` detailed in the official docs).

```julia-repl
julia> using Pkg
```

Now to create our project.

```julia-repl
julia> Pkg.generate("ImportantWork")
```

The output looks something like this:

```text
  Generating  project ImportantWork:
    ImportantWork/Project.toml
    ImportantWork/src/ImportantWork.jl
Dict{String, Base.UUID} with 1 entry:
  "ImportantWork" => UUID("4b610261-c434-4966-b823-52987c24b398")
```

The Julia package manager just generated:

- a directory, `ImportantWork` ⇒ where everything for the project lives
- a subdirectory, `ImportantWork/src` ⇒ for building our code base
- a file, `ImportantWork/src/ImportantWork.jl` ⇒ a module (think `main`)
- a file, `ImportantWork/Project.toml` ⇒ for describing the environment
- a UUID we won't worry about for now

Let's step into our new project with `cd`.

```julia-repl
julia> cd("ImportantWork")
```

And check out `Project.toml`.

```julia-repl
julia> edit("Project.toml")
```

The file contains some basic information about the project's environment.

```text
name = "ImportantWork"
uuid = "4b610261-c434-4966-b823-52987c24b398"
authors = ["Your Name <you@example.com>"]
version = "0.1.0"
```

To begin working with this new environment, simply activate it.

```julia-repl
julia> Pkg.activate(".")  # the . here means 'this directory'
```

Now we can continue to the important project work. To do so, we'll need the
important `XKCD.jl` package. So let's add it to the project.

```julia-repl
julia> Pkg.add("XKCD")
```

```text
Updating registry at `~/.julia/registries/General`
   Resolving package versions...
    Updating `~/Repos/ImportantWork/Project.toml`
  [4bc7fa8b] + XKCD v1.0.1
    Updating `~/Repos/ImportantWork/Manifest.toml`

  [4ec0a83e] + Unicode
  [c8ffd9c3] + MbedTLS_jll
Precompiling project...
  1 dependency successfully precompiled in 1 seconds (9 already precompiled)
```

The `Project.toml` can again tell us what changed. There are 2 new lines.

```text
[deps]
XKCD = "4bc7fa8b-4ef2-4643-8c8b-cef036f85839"
```

Indicating that our project has a new dependency.

We are now free to use the package in our project.

```julia-repl
julia> edit("src/ImportantWork.jl")
```

Paste the following code in the file. Save and quit.

```julia
module ImportantWork

using XKCD

export meaning_of_life
export life_online

meaning_of_life() = XKCD.Comic(42)
life_online() = XKCD.Comic(256)

end # module
```

Finally, we can get the answers we seek. Furthermore, if we are sure to include
the `Project.toml` then we can share our important work with others. Then they
too can get the answers.

```julia-repl
julia> using ImportantWork
julia> meaning_of_life()
```

![geico](./geico.jpg)

```julia-repl
julia> life_online()
```

![online-communities](./online_communities.png)
