Or things can be free, as in speech, as in do whatever you want just leave me out of it. Linux is the shining example of both.</p> <h3 id=gnu_linux ><a href="#gnu_linux" class=header-anchor >GNU / Linux</a></h3> <p>Linux &#40;or GNU/Linux&#41; is a free and open-source operating system that I started using around 2018. Actually, my first encounter was in 2016, but I was a mere philistine who couldn&#39;t comprehend its relevance. Not coincidentally, re-introduction corresponded with my joining a high-powered development team. Embracing Linux &#40;and open-source software in general&#41; revealed a new perspective on what was possible on computers.</p> <p>However, there is some good news and some bad news. Such is life.</p> <h3 id=bad_news ><a href="#bad_news" class=header-anchor >Bad News</a></h3> <p>There is an old adage:</p> <blockquote> <p>Linux is only free if your time has no value.<sup id="fnref:linux"><a href="#fndef:linux" class=fnref >[2]</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>I.e., prepare yourself for a time-sink.</p> <p>I believe most Linux users would concede this point.<sup id="fnref:but"><a href="#fndef:but" class=fnref >[3]</a></sup> The learning curve is real, it can be steep, and only the committed among us survive the journey to reap the reward.</p> <p>While we&#39;re at it, let&#39;s gripe a bit:</p> <p>üçá Terminals are scary &#40;at first&#41;<sup id="fnref:term"><a href="#fndef:term" class=fnref >[4]</a></sup></p> <p>üçá Hardware support not guaranteed &#42;cough&#42; GPUs &amp; Bluetooth</p> <p>üçá Foot-guns are a thing</p> <p>What&#39;s a <em>foot-gun</em> you ask. Let me demonstrate.</p> <h4 id=dependency_hell ><a href="#dependency_hell" class=header-anchor >Dependency Hell</a></h4> <p><img src="./world-of-pain.jpg" alt=world-of-pain  /></p> <p>Ever heard of <a href="https://harfbuzz.github.io/"><code>harfbuzz</code></a>? Me neither until I thought ligatures were a real terminal necessity. Don&#39;t know what ligatures are? Maybe your better off not knowing.<sup id="fnref:jk"><a href="#fndef:jk" class=fnref >[5]</a></sup> Gross over simplification - <code>harfbuzz</code> is a library needed for ligatures. No problem - there&#39;s a build section in the library docs, and after my first <code>meson build</code> I have my ligatures&#33;</p> <p>I&#39;m pretty pleased until some time later upon realizing that several other programs depend on this library and are now failing. One solution proposed on Arch Wiki was to set the <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> environment variable to help each program find its preferred library. Kind of a hack-y band aid, but it got me unstuck and working again. &quot;Flipping&quot; this additional switch was fine until I ran across programs that failed no matter which way the switch was flipped. Finally, I was forced to confront the real problem.</p> <p>The solution - do another <code>meson build</code> with an additional flag that was needed for my particular system and which was not well documented. This was painful. When you&#39;re navigating uncharted waters, it&#39;s unclear where the danger will be lurking. However, that does <em>NOT</em> mean that you should be scared to explore. This bout frustrated me at times, but I learned about <code>harfbuzz</code> and why programs like <code>Libre Office</code> and <code>Pandoc</code> rely on it.</p> <p>Anyone who gets started with Linux will find their own unique <em><em>Harfbuzz Hell</em></em> because each user will customize their machine to their liking for their functions. So best advise is embrace it and look for the learning opportunities. They are plentiful.</p> <h3 id=good_news ><a href="#good_news" class=header-anchor >Good News</a></h3> <p>Congratulations for making it to the good news &#40;we&#39;re almost done here&#41;. In keeping with the theme, here is another obscure quote.</p> <blockquote> <p>To live only for some future goal is shallow. It&#39;s the sides of the mountain which sustain life, not the top. Here&#39;s where things grow.<sup id="fnref:zen"><a href="#fndef:zen" class=fnref >[6]</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>Diving into the unknown and keeping an open mind will reveal many treasures among the growing pains. There is a lot to explore. So many brilliant people have worked hard on open-source projects and selflessly shared the end product. There&#39;s really no <em>need</em> to pay for an operating system or any software if you don&#39;t want to. A little exploration will prove this, and those things which seemed scary will turn out to be over-sized teddy bears.</p> <p>There&#39;s too many to count, but here are some things I appreciate:</p> <ul> <li><p>üíô Terminals ‚áí beautifully simple command line tools<sup id="fnref:cli"><a href="#fndef:cli" class=fnref >[7]</a></sup></p> <li><p>üíô Open-source ‚áí constant innovations</p> <li><p>üíô Shell ‚áí script automate everything</p> <li><p>üíô Options ‚áí for those who want better</p> <li><p>üíô Freedom &#40;as in speech&#41; ‚áí customize everything<sup id="fnref:de"><a href="#fndef:de" class=fnref >[8]</a></sup></p> </ul> <h4 id=perfect_fit ><a href="#perfect_fit" class=header-anchor >Perfect Fit</a></h4> <p>Every person has different need, use-case, aesthetic, etc. It follows that every person has a different <em>perfect</em> computer setup. Just like how the world is not black and white, not everyone can be fully described in one of two buckets.<sup id="fnref:os"><a href="#fndef:os" class=fnref >[9]</a></sup></p> <p>There is a richness in diversity in Linux. Users have a choice of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution">distribution</a> suited for particular purposes and tastes &#40;maybe too many choices so just pick <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> to start then <a href="https://embeddedinventor.com/distro-hopping-what-why-how-explained/">hop</a> to your desire&#41;. Users have a choice of <a href="https://itsfoss.com/what-is-desktop-environment/">desktop environment</a> that will help them fine tune the look and feel that works best for them. Finally, users have full control of their systems. Users can do <em>anything</em> and are only limited by the time they choose invest.</p> <h2 id=conclusion ><a href="#conclusion" class=header-anchor >Conclusion</a></h2> <p><img src="./opinion.jpg" alt=opinion  /></p> <p>Good software exists. Some of it&#39;s free-as-in-beer, some of it&#39;s free-as-in-speech. There&#39;s many cases of both throughout Linux and the wider Open-source community. Best part - it&#39;s for everybody&#33;</p> <p>Remember, you are not alone. There is a strong community of Linux enthusiasts in the world who are willing and able to help you get started. Anyone can do this and there is nothing to lose.</p> <p>Linux &#40;and Open-source software in general&#41; is a bountiful garden.
